# Automating Cryptocurrency API Data Pull, Processing, and Visualization

## Overview
This project automates the process of pulling cryptocurrency data (e.g., Bitcoin) from the CoinMarketCap API, saving it to a CSV file, cleaning and transforming the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing key insights.

---

## Key Features

### Automated API Data Pulling:
- Retrieves real-time cryptocurrency data using the CoinMarketCap API.
- Automatically saves the data into a CSV file (`API.csv`).

### Data Loading and Cleaning:
- Loads the data into pandas DataFrames for further processing.
- Cleans and transforms the data for readability and analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzes the percentage changes in cryptocurrency prices over different time periods (1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, etc.).
- Groups and calculates mean percentage changes for all cryptocurrencies.

### Visualizations:
- **Percent Changes**: A point plot visualizing percentage changes across various time frames.
- **Bitcoin Price Trends**: A time-series line plot showing Bitcoin price trends over time.

## Project Workflow

### API Automation:
- The `api_runner()` function automates data fetching using the CoinMarketCap API.
- Data is pulled in intervals and appended to a CSV file (`API.csv`).

### Data Cleaning and Transformation:
- The data is loaded and cleaned for inconsistencies.
- Transformed into a stacked format for better visualization and analysis.

### EDA and Visualization:
- Mean percentage changes are calculated for cryptocurrencies across multiple time frames.
- Visualizations are generated for key insights, such as:
  - Percent changes for all cryptocurrencies.
  - Bitcoin price trends over time.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `requests`: API interactions.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Data visualization.

---

## Visualizations

### Percent Changes Across Time Frames
- Displays the percentage change in cryptocurrency prices (1h, 24h, 7d, etc.).

### Bitcoin Price Trends
- A time-series visualization of Bitcoin prices over time.

---

## File Structure
- **`API.csv`**: Stores the fetched API data.
- **`automate_crypto.py`**: The main Python script to automate the workflow.
- **Visualizations**: Automatically generated by the script.
